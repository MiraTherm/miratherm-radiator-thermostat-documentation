A radiator thermostat is a device, which is mounted on a heating radiator valve to control the flow of hot water through it. This allows the thermostat to regulate the room temperature.

As described in \cite{ELVjournal.2012} and shown in figure \ref{fig:rt-photo}, a digital radiator thermostat typically consists of the following components:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \ac{pcb} with \ac{ui} including buttons, rotary encoder, display, motor driver, and other components
	\item \ac{dc} motor
	\item Gear box with planetary gears
	\item Valve connector
\end{itemize}

Most digital thermostats are \ac{mcu}-based and battery powered. Smart thermostats often include additional features such as \ac{wlan} or \ac{ble} connectivity and mobile app integration. 

Descriptions of common thermostats such as eQ-3 MAX! from \cite{ELVjournal.2012} and eQ-3 eqiva Bluetooth from \cite{eQ3AG.05.2018} can be used as a reference for functional scope of the software to develop. For example they implement following functions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Mode selection (Auto, Manual, Boost, Vacation)
	\item Manual temperature adjustment
	\item Weekly schedule programming
	\item Decalcification program
	\item Open-window function
\end{itemize}

Commonly the following qualities are expected from digital radiator thermostats:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Low power consumption to maximize battery life (e.g. 2 years on 2 AA batteries)
	\item Reliability (e.g. operation on valves with minor calcification)
	\item User-friendly \ac{ui}
	\item Easy installation and setup
\end{itemize}
